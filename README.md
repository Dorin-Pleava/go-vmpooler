go-vmpooler provides a depdendency free Go client library for working with [vmpooler](https://github.com/puppetlabs/vmpooler).

Vmpooler provides configurable 'pools' of instantly-available virtual machines running on VMWare VSphere. 

## Usage

Refer to the example programs in `examples/token` and `examples\vm` for some ideas on how to use the client.

*Note that the `token` example requires the `golang.org/x/crypto/ssh/terminal` package be installed, its used to suppress echoing of the password to stdout when prompting the user to enter it.*

Refer to the [godocs](https://godoc.org/github.com/johnmccabe/go-vmpooler) for the following packages for more info.

- [token](https://godoc.org/github.com/johnmccabe/go-vmpooler/token)
- [vm](https://godoc.org/github.com/johnmccabe/go-vmpooler/token)
